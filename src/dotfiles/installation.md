# Installation

## Requirements
Make sure to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [yadm](https://yadm.io/), and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) installed. If not, then this simple script will install them:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danjvarela/dotfiles/master/.config/yadm/install.sh)"
```

## Using yadm
Clone the dotfiles repo using **yadm**, type `y` if asked to execute the bootstrap script.
```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/danjvarela/dotfiles.git
```
